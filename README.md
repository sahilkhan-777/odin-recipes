# Odin Recipes

A beginner-friendly web project that showcases a collection of simple and delicious recipes. This project was built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum to practice core web development skills.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of:

* Basic HTML structure and semantic elements
  * Headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists

* CSS for styling and layout
  * Typography, spacing, colors, and visual enhancements

* Multiple HTML pages linked together (each recipe on its own page)

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

* Structure web pages using semantic HTML tags
* Link multiple HTML files within a single project
* Apply CSS for consistent styling across pages
* Organize project files for a clean folder structure

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

* Add more recipes to expand the collection
* Make the site responsive for better viewing on phones and tablets
* Use Flexbox or Grid for improved layout control
* Add more interactivity with JavaScript
